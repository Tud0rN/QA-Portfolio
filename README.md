About me 👋
Hi, my name is Tudor. Since the summer of 2024 I have been studying and practicing to become a QA Tester. I am happy to have found an new area in which I can successfully develop myself and my skills. Through the QA I try to think outside of the box and establish fixes and improvements for a more pleasent user experience and every day life. Through this portfolio, I would like to showcase my knowledge of QA Tester and my practical skills that I have gained through courses, self-study and my Job. I have also started learning test automation in, so at the moment my main focus is on furthering my knowledge in this area.
